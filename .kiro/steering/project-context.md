# ImageZip - Project Context

## Project Overview
ImageZip is a single-purpose web application built for the AI for Bharat Week 1 Micro-Tools challenge. It solves one specific problem elegantly: compressing images instantly in the browser.

## Problem Statement
Users often need to compress images for:
- Faster website loading times
- Reducing email attachment sizes
- Saving storage space
- Optimizing for social media uploads

Existing solutions often require:
- Uploading images to third-party servers (privacy concerns)
- Installing heavy software
- Complex interfaces with too many options

## Solution
ImageZip provides:
- **100% Client-Side Processing**: All compression happens in the browser using HTML5 Canvas API
- **Simple Interface**: Two compression modes (lossy/lossless) with an intuitive quality slider
- **Instant Results**: Before/after comparison with file size savings
- **Privacy-First**: Images never leave the user's device
- **Zero Installation**: Works directly in any modern browser

## Technical Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure and Canvas API for image processing
- **CSS3**: Modern, responsive design with gradients and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks for maximum performance and simplicity
- **FileReader API**: Client-side file handling

## Features
1. **Drag & Drop Upload**: Easy file selection
2. **Lossy Compression**: JPEG format with adjustable quality (10-100%)
3. **Lossless Compression**: PNG format maintaining original quality
4. **Visual Comparison**: Side-by-side before/after preview
5. **File Size Metrics**: Shows original size, compressed size, and percentage saved
6. **Instant Download**: One-click download of compressed images
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
